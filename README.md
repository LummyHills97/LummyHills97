# 👋 Hi, I'm **Olumide Oluwaseun Akinnuli**

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in mobile application development, with a focus on building reliable, intuitive, and scalable products. I work primarily with Flutter and Dart, and I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code that supports long-term growth.

My approach to engineering is grounded in clarity, thoughtful design, and a strong respect for the user. I value simplicity, consistency, and the discipline of refining solutions until they feel both elegant and practical.

I’m committed to continuous learning, improving my craft, and contributing to software that is both technically solid and genuinely useful.
